# Language Practice App

This project is a mobile application designed to help users learn and practice words in different languages. It allows users to add new words, practice them, and keep track of the words they have memorized.

## Features

- **Add Words:** Users can add new words they want to learn along with their translations in English and Turkish.
- **Practice:** Practice with added words. The app selects a random word and asks the user to enter its translation.
- **Memorized Words:** Users can add words they think they have memorized to a list. This list can be reviewed later.
- **Restore Words:** Memorized words can be restored back to the main word list for further practice.
